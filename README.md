## What it does

Coloring in Photoshop can be tedious, especially when you want clean edges without jagged white borders. **Coloriage** automates the entire flatting workflow in a single click:

1. **Expands** your selection by 2 pixels
2. **Creates** a new layer
3. **Fills** with your foreground color
4. **Places** the layer below the original
5. **Merges** while keeping the original layer name

**Bonus:** The selection stays active, so you can run the script multiple times to expand further if needed.

## Setting up a keyboard shortcut (recommended)

For maximum speed, create a keyboard shortcut via Actions:

1. Open the **Actions panel** (Window > Actions or `Alt+F9`)
2. Create a new action set (folder icon)
3. Create a new action (`+` icon)
   - Name: "Coloriage"
   - Assign a function key (e.g., `F5`)
4. Click **Record**
5. Go to **File > Scripts > Browse...** and select `Coloriage.jsx`
6. Stop recording (square icon)

Now you can run Coloriage with your chosen keyboard shortcut!

Detailed installation guides (French + English) are included in the download.

## Usage

1. **Select** an area on your line art layer (using Lasso, Magic Wand, or any selection tool)
2. **Run** the script (File > Scripts > Coloriage or your keyboard shortcut)
3. **Done!** Your selection is filled and properly layered

The selection remains active, allowing you to run the script again for additional 2-pixel expansions.
